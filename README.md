# POST data from Discord Bot through a Discord Channel to Airtable Base


## Description

In this Repo, We are sending records to their respective fields in an Airtable Base' Table in realtime. For that, we are using a Discord Bot to act as a Channel of Input.


## Airtable Base

An Airtable base contains all of the information you need for a particular project or collection. Each of the square icons on your homepage is a different base. It's kind of like a workbook in a traditional spreadsheet, and can contain multiple tables of content.

## Discord 

Bots and apps are the lifeblood of the Discord development community. They come in all shapes and sizes, from small hobby projects for your server with friends, to huge projects that live in hundreds of thousands of servers. We love seeing the unique, fun, and sometimes downright strange (in a good way) creations that come from our community.
